# Analyzing-Energy-Data
This project revolves around the analysis of energy-related data, covering a range of tasks from data cleaning to visualization. 
Beginning with the data loading and cleaning phase, an Excel file containing energy indicators was processed, excluding unnecessary header and footer information and converting energy supply values into gigajoules. 
The subsequent step involved merging this data with information on GDP and Scimago Journal ranks for various countries, allowing for the identification of the top 15 countries by journal rank over the past decade. 
Moving on to data analysis, the project tackled questions involving the average GDP of these top countries, the GDP change for the country with the sixth-highest average GDP, and the mean energy supply per capita across all countries. 
Furthermore, the analysis sought to determine which country boasted the highest percentage of renewable electricity production and identify the one with the maximum self-citations to total citations ratio. 
The project also estimated the third most populous country based on energy supply and supply per capita. 
It calculated the correlation between citable documents per capita and energy supply per capita and categorized countries based on their renewable energy production levels. 
Lastly, the project grouped countries by continent and their renewable energy production bins, revealing the number of countries in each group. 
An optional bubble chart visualization was provided to depict % Renewable vs. Rank, where bubble sizes represented GDP and colors represented continents.
